# Udacity- Investigate a dataset: No-Show Appointments Data
In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis is done on the no-show appointments dataset, using python, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze the dataset and communicate my findings. 
## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying the data analysis process to no-show appointments.
 
 Starting from **questions asked** about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, followed by the **data wrangling process** to understand the data set, and then the **data cleaning** phase to handle any problems that may harden the investigation of the data, then the **exploratory data analysis** using the visualization for better understanding of the data patterns and finally representing the insights in a **conclusion**.

### What did I learn?
- It helped me understand all the steps involved in the data analysis process and get my hand dirty applying them.
- I am comfortable with posing questions that can be answered by investigating a dataset and I am capable of doing this investigation.
- I know how to handle problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use.
- It helped me to better communicate my results and show my findings using  Matplotlib.
## Data
